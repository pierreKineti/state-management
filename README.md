# RxAngular

RxAngular is a library for building reactive applications using Angular. It is based on RxJS, which is a library for reactive programming. RxAngular provides a set of tools and utilities that make it easy to build reactive components and applications in Angular.

In this README, we will explore three different parts of RxAngular that are useful for building an ecommerce application: state management, template management, and component development kit (CDK).

## State Management

Managing state is an important part of building any application, and ecommerce applications are no exception. With RxAngular, managing state can be done in a reactive and efficient way using the `ngrx` library.

`ngrx` is a state management library that is based on RxJS and provides a way to manage the state of your application in a reactive and predictable way. With `ngrx`, you can define actions that describe changes to your application state, reducers that handle those actions and update the state, and selectors that allow you to select and retrieve data from the state.

Here is an example of how you could use `ngrx` to manage the state of an ecommerce application:
